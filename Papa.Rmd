abstract: |
  Five-month old infants listened to songs sung by their parent, a toy,or someone unfamiliar for one to two week period. These songs had the same lyrics and rhythms. However, the melodies were different. The researchers tested the infants selected attention when a random person sang the song they were familiar with and the song they were not. The results indicated that infants paid more attention to the song they were familiar with, and that exposure time predicted preference time. This suggests that melodies may carry social meanings for infants.

# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.
```{r}
baseline <- experiment_one$Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer
mean(baseline)
sd(baseline)
hist(baseline)
```
T-test analysis
```{r}
t.test(baseline, mu=.5)
```
So, there we have it. We did a one-sample t-test. Hereâ€™s how you would report it, t(31) = .67, p = .505. Or, we might say something like:

During the baseline condition, the mean proportion looking time toward the singer was .52, and was not significantly different from .5, according to a one-sample test, t(31) = .67, p = .505.

# Results
###apa print function will make a table of the data you ran(anova table) if you write something and then put`r write something other tick-that treats as r code some this test significant tick r F value p value tick-----a=1,2,3,sapply(a,fun=function(x)return (x+1))

```{r myfig, fig.cap="This is histo"}
